# Security Policy

## Secure Agent Execution

tideon.ai provides multiple layers of security for running code-executing agents:

### Sandboxed Execution

- **Docker Sandbox**: Isolated container execution with resource limits
- **Memory Limits**: Configurable memory caps
- **Network Isolation**: Optional network disabling
- **Timeout Controls**: Automatic termination of long-running code

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
