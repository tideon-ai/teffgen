# tideon.ai Release Notes

## v0.2.0 — April 9, 2026

**tideon.ai v0.2.0** is a major release that transforms the framework into a production-grade agentic AI platform. 15 development phases deliver powerful new capabilities — all optimized for Small Language Models.

### Top 5 Features

1. **Native Tool Calling & Structured Output** — Models like Qwen, Llama, and Mistral can now use their built-in function calling instead of text-based ReAct parsing. Set `tool_calling_mode="native"` or `"hybrid"` in AgentConfig. JSON schema and Pydantic model output validation included.

2. **Guardrails & Safety** — Protect your agents with `PIIGuardrail`, `PromptInjectionGuardrail`, `ToxicityGuardrail`, `ToolPermissionGuardrail`, and more. Use presets: `get_guardrail_preset("strict")` for instant configuration.

3. **Advanced RAG Pipeline** — Full document ingestion (PDF, DOCX, HTML, Markdown, CSV, JSON), semantic/code/table/hierarchical chunking, hybrid search (dense + BM25 + keyword), reranking, source attribution with inline citations. One-liner: `create_agent("rag", model, knowledge_base="./docs/")`.

4. **Production API Server** — OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, request queuing with priority, agent pooling, multi-tenancy with API key management, CORS, GZip, graceful shutdown. Drop-in replacement for OpenAI API with local SLMs.

5. **Apple Silicon Native (MLX)** — Community-contributed MLX and MLX-VLM backends for Apple Silicon. Native Metal GPU acceleration with unified memory. `pip install teffgen[mlx]` — no CUDA required.

### What's New

- **31 built-in tools** (up from 14) — finance (stock/currency/crypto), data science (DataFrame/Plot/Stats), DevOps (Git/Docker/SystemInfo/HTTP), knowledge (Arxiv/StackOverflow/GitHub/Wolfram), communication (EmailDraft/SlackDraft/Notification)
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — MessageBus pub/sub, DAG-based workflows (YAML), shared state, agent lifecycle management with pools and registries
- **Model router** — automatic model selection based on query complexity; multi-model agents with speculative execution; model pool with LRU eviction
- **Checkpointing & sessions** — save/restore agent state mid-task; persistent conversation sessions across processes; background task runner with pause/resume/cancel
- **Evaluation framework** — 5 built-in test suites (270 test cases), regression tracking, model comparison matrix; `teffgen eval` and `teffgen compare` CLI
- **Observability** — full OpenTelemetry tracing, structured JSON logging with correlation IDs, Prometheus metrics with percentiles, Grafana dashboard template, interactive debug mode
- **Human-in-the-loop** — approval workflows for dangerous tools, clarification requests, feedback collection
- **Performance** — prompt caching (LRU + TTL), result caching with semantic similarity, token budget management, lazy model loading, GGUF/AWQ/GPTQ quantization, continuous batching, speculative decoding hints
- **Python & TypeScript SDKs** — `TeffgenClient` with sync/async, streaming, retries; TypeScript client for Node/Deno/Bun/browser
- **Local embedding API** — `/v1/embeddings` endpoint with sentence-transformers + TF-IDF fallback, LRU + SQLite caching
- **Domain keyword expansion** — 5 built-in domains (Tech/Science/Finance/Health/Legal) with WordNet/template/LLM-based expansion

### Upgrading from v0.1.x

## v0.1.3 — March 25, 2026

v0.1.3 addresses 19 issues discovered during v0.1.2 verification, hardening the framework for real-world SLM agent usage.

### Highlights

- **Smarter loop detection** — allows 1 retry before flagging exact loops, raises threshold for data-processing tools, and normalizes inputs before comparison. Fewer false positives in multi-step pipelines.
- **"Skip the tool" prompting** — ReAct prompt now explicitly tells SLMs they can answer directly without tools. Reduces unnecessary tool calls for greetings, jokes, and recall tasks.
- **Model-aware token counting** — ShortTermMemory uses the loaded model's tokenizer instead of the `len//4` heuristic, improving summarization trigger accuracy.
- **Sub-agent depth limit** — configurable `max_sub_agent_depth` (default 3) prevents infinite sub-agent recursion.
- **Circuit breaker persistence** — optional JSON file persistence so breaker state survives agent restarts.

### What's Improved

- Partial answer extraction now finds day names and numeric results in tool observations
- Model-family prompt formatters differentiated (Qwen `<|tools|>` tags, Llama header/EOT tags)
- Removed `\n\n\n` stop sequence that truncated multi-paragraph output
- Streaming examples hardened with SIGALRM timeouts
- Integration test fixtures gracefully fall back to fp16 when bitsandbytes is missing
- NotImplementedError stubs in MCP and Retrieval now include descriptive messages

### What's Fixed

- Loop detection false positives on JSON data pipelines
- SLMs over-using tools for tasks that don't need them
- DateTimeTool date queries more reliable (better answer extraction)
- Silent model loading failures now logged with clear warning

## v0.1.2 — March 12, 2026

v0.1.2 is a test-driven hardening release. Every feature was built by creating a real agent, testing it across multiple models (0.5B to 8B), watching what breaks, and fixing the framework.

### Highlights

- **10 comprehensive example agents** — Q&A, calculator, multi-tool, file operations, code execution, conversational memory, error recovery, data processing, streaming, and multi-agent pipeline orchestration
- **19 framework bugs fixed** — discovered through real inference testing, not unit tests. Fixes cover tool parsing, answer extraction, memory management, and model-specific edge cases
- **Cross-model compatibility matrix** — 11 models tested across all 10 agents. 73% pass rate (80 PASS, 23 PARTIAL, 7 FAIL out of 110 combinations)
- **Top models (10/10 PASS):** Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, Phi-4-mini-instruct

### What's New

- 10 example agents in `examples/` with full documentation, model recommendations, and interactive modes
- Compatibility matrix at `examples/compatibility_matrix.md` with per-agent model recommendations
- User-explicit sub-agent trigger detection (e.g., "use 3 agents to parallelize this")
- Sweep runner (`examples/sweep_model.py`) for automated cross-model testing

### What's Improved

- ReAct loop is more robust — better loop detection, answer extraction, and error recovery
- Tool input parsing handles single-quoted JSON, non-JSON inputs, and markdown fences
- Conversation history is better managed — configurable turn limits, auto-summarization, response truncation
- Tool results are properly formatted for the model (no more raw dicts)

### What's Fixed

- 4-bit quantization now works correctly with TransformersEngine
- gemma-3 context length detection fixed for nested config
- DateTimeTool `now` operation respects date parameter
- PythonREPL no longer double-prints output
- Absolute file paths no longer get their leading slash stripped
- Many more — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full list

### Model Recommendations

| Use Case | Minimum | Recommended |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Q&A (no tools) | 0.5B | 1.5B+ |
| Tool calling | 1.5B | 3B |
| Multi-turn conversation | 1.5B | 3B |
| Multi-agent pipeline | 1.5B | 3B |

## v0.1.1 — March 6, 2026

v0.1.1 is a stabilization release that fixes metadata inconsistencies, improves error handling, adds 6 new examples, and expands the test suite.

### What's Fixed
- License references now consistently say Apache-2.0 everywhere (was MIT in some files)
- `setup.py` entry points, Development Status, and dependency versions now match `pyproject.toml`
- 5 bare `except:` handlers in GPU monitoring replaced with specific exception types
- 15+ stray `print()` calls converted to structured logging

### What's New
- 6 example scripts: presets, streaming, memory, multi-tool, weather, and plugin usage
- 50+ new tests covering CLI, API server, plugins, presets, fallback chains, and circuit breakers
- Top-level convenience imports for `ToolFallbackChain`, `CircuitBreaker`, `ToolPromptGenerator`, `AgentSystemPromptBuilder`
- `NEWS.md` for user-friendly release summaries

### What's Changed
- Error handlers across execution modules now log exceptions instead of silently swallowing them
- Comprehensive lint cleanup via ruff (2200+ auto-fixes)
